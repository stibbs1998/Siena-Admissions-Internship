Much of the boilerplate code for visualizations came from [here](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html#bar-charts).


The [hd2017.csv](https://github.com/stibbs1998/admissions_internship/blob/master/data/external/hd2017.csv) and [InstitutionCampus.csv](https://github.com/stibbs1998/admissions_internship/blob/master/data/external/InstitutionCampus.csv) files were downloaded from [Database of Accredited Postesecondary Instituions and Programs](https://ope.ed.gov/dapip/#/home).


The [CARES_zipcode_data_v3.pkl](https://github.com/stibbs1998/admissions_internship/blob/master/data/external/CARES_zipcode_data_v3.pkl) file was taken from [Matt Bellis](https://github.com/mattbellis/CARES_tools/blob/master/CARES_zipcode_data_v3.pkl).


The [FIPS.csv](https://github.com/stibbs1998/admissions_internship/blob/master/data/external/FIPS.csv) file was taken from [www.mdreducation.com](https://www.mdreducation.com/pdfs/US_FIPS_Codes.xls).

The [income_data.csv](https://github.com/stibbs1998/admissions_internship/blob/master/data/external/income_data.csv) file was generously given to us from Tara Cope, who had previously pulled data from the [US Census Bureau](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml?).

The [us-states.json](https://github.com/stibbs1998/admissions_internship/blob/master/data/external/us-states.json) file was taken from [here](https://github.com/PublicaMundi/MappingAPI/blob/master/data/geojson/us-states.json).
